mail-reminder
=============

mail-reminder is a small utility that is intended to be used in a cron job to
send mail reminders about events. Events can be weekly, biweekly or monthly
recurring events, or events defined in a schedule.

The events considered by mail-reminder are defined in .conf files. By default,
mail-reminder handles all .conf files in the data subdirectory from the
mail-reminder directory. Alternatively, .conf files can be passed as arguments.

Since it's too easy to send mails by accident while testing mail-reminder, the
default behavior is to use a debug output. Once everything is configured
properly, the --no-debug option can be used so that mails will be sent.


Configuration files
===================

Configuration files are using a simple key-file format.

There are four sections that can be used:

[event]
## Contains the main description of the events (mandatory).
## Following keys exist:
#
# 'type' key is mandatory. Possible value:
#   - weekly: weekly events
#   - biweekly: biweekly events (every two weeks :-))
#   - monthly: monthly events
#   - schedule: events defined in the [schedule] section
type=
#
# 'biweekly_week' key is mandatory if 'type' key is 'biweekly'. This should be
# either 0 or 1, to decide which of the week from every two weeks is the right
# one.
biweekly_week=
#
# 'day' key is mandatory if 'type' key is one of 'weekly', 'biweekly',
# 'monthly'. For 'weekly' and 'biweekly', its value should be between 1 (Monday)
# and 7 (Sunday). For 'monthly', its value should be between 1 and 31 (note that
# if 29, 30 or 31 is used, the last day of the month will trigger the reminder
# if the configured day doesn't exist in the month -- like in February)
day=

[mail]
## Contains the information about when and what to send by mail (mandatory).
## One of 'mail_on_rel_days' and 'mail_on_day_week_before' keys must be present.
#
# 'mail_on_rel_days' can be used to send a reminder a few days before an event.
# Its value should be between -6 (6 days before event) and -1 (the day before
# event).
mail_on_rel_days=
#
# 'mail_on_day_week_before' can be used to send a reminder the week before an
# event, on a fixed day. Its value should be between 1 (Monday) and 7 (Sunday).
mail_on_day_week_before=
#
# 'template' key is mandatory. It defines the path to a mail template to be used
# for the reminder.
template=

[template variables]
## Contains some variable definitions, for variables to be used in the mail
## template (optional).
#
# Definition are in the following form:
# variable=value

[schedule]
## List of events for a configuration of type 'schedule' (mandatory if type is
## 'schedule).
#
# Definition are in the following form:
# date=description
# 'date' is in the YYYY-MM-DD format. For instance: 2012-03-31
#
# Note that the description will automatically be set as a template variable
# for the event.


Mail template
=============

The mail template should contain all headers of the mail that are needed for the
mail to make sense (generally: From, To, Subject) and the mail body.

Variable substitution will be used. For instance, if the 'user' variable is
defined in the 'template variables' section, then all uses of '%(user)s' in the
template will be expanded to the value of the 'user' variable.

The following variables can always be used:

 - year: year of next event
 - month: month year of next event (between 1 and 12)
 - day: day in month of next event (between 1 and 31)
 - date: date of next event in human-readable format (Thursday 05 April 2012)

A variable that is not defined cannot be used in the template; it will result in
an error.


Configuration examples
======================

Here is an example of a weekly event occurring each Wednesday, for which a
reminder will be set on Tuesday:

  [event]
  type=weekly
  # Meeting on Wednesday (Monday = 1)
  day=3
  
  [mail]
  # Mail the day before
  mail_on_rel_days=-1
  template=meeting.mail
  
  [template variables]
  hour=20
  minute=00

Here is an example of a schedule of events, with reminders being sent on a fixed
day the week before an event:

  [event]
  type=schedule
  
  [mail]
  # Mail on Wednesday of the week before next event (Monday = 1)
  mail_on_day_week_before=3
  template=schedule.mail
  
  [template variables]
  cycle=
  
  [schedule]
  2012-04-29=Planning starts
  2012-05-20=Implentation starts
  2012-06-04=Testing starts


Mail template example
=====================

The following is a simple example of mail template. The configuration file has
'status=not too important' in the 'template variables' section.

  From: Reminder Script <reminder@example.net>
  To: jane@example.net
  Subject: [reminder] Next event is on %(date)s
  
  Hi Jane,
  
  This is a reminder that your next event is on %(date)s.
  This event is %(status)s.
